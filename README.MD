A little tool to learn words.

It opens a file named `dictionary.md`. Example of dictionary contents:

```
// section_1
word, words;das Wort;die Wörter
```


In case of several words in an answer there should be just on space in between them, so in the example above the correct input is:

```das Wort die Wörter```
